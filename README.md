# BasicFormsExample
Creation of a basic Form with Angular JS 


## Form Content

1) Mail Address (should not be empty and should be an email address)
2) A DropDown wich allows the user to select from three different Subscriptions
3) A password field (should not be empty)
4) A Submit Button

## Tasks of Validation

Display a warning message if the Form is invalid AND was touched.
Display a warning message below each input if it's invalid.
Upon submitting the form, you should simply print the Value of the Form.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
